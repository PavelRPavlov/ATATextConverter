This is a simple text conver which is designed to be used by ATA Furniture to easily create orders to Lonira.

The converter uses a text file, generated by Polyboard and generates several excel files based on the text.

# Polyboard settings
To properly implement the conversion, this converter requires the exporting feature of Polyboard to be setup in a specific way. Otherwise there is no way to reliably decode the text file.

To apply the expected Polyboard settings, navigate to **Settings** -> **Export settings** -> **Export format**

In the **Values** field enter the following string: **width;height;count;name**
